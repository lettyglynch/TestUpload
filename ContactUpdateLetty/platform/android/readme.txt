If changing back to original theme delete /res and unzip res.zip
Has all original assests... which jsut cinsists of titanium logo pngs

EDIT 03.30.15:
Swapped out the Light theme for the dark one. As a general UI/UX thing, you really don't want dark text on darker colors. The black and maroon was a little ugly, imo.

In the wonderific world of custom theming, light and dark refers to the main color of the theme and not the color of the font/icons/whatever. So this is the dark theme which means white fotns and whatnot. the actual View fonts are done on the fly in the .tss files. Totally seperate from the theme XML stuff.

I'm leaving the light theme stuff in this dir as a jsut in case. I plan on cleaning everything up after it's all said and done.
